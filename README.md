# Manual Setup
### Summary:
1. Install [`Python 3.8 - 3.12`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install [`OpenAI Whisper`](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

### Setup Guides:
<details>
<summary>Windows Setup</summary>
       
### Step 1: Install Python
Download [Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or any version > 3.8) and run the installer. Make sure to tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during installation. <br><br> <img alt="Python Installer" src="https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/assets/72154813/0a47e465-f1d6-4955-90d5-dfa211d9ba01" width="500">

    pip install -U openai-whisper

### Step 3: Install FFMPEG

Install [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) (for audio processing). I recommend using a package manager as it makes the install process less confusing.

    # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/install)
    choco install ffmpeg

    # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/)
    scoop install ffmpeg

Install Stable-TS by running this command in the terminal:

    pip install -U stable-ts

# Update AutoSubs

### Automatic (Windows Only):

### Manual (Windows, Mac, Linux)
Download the [`auto-subs.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs.py) file and add it to one of the following directories:

1. **Windows:**
    - All users: `%PROGRAMDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts`
    - Specific user: `%APPDATA%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts`

2. **Mac OS:**

## Light Version
> [!NOTE]
> **Audio transcription has been removed on this version**. This means less setup, but a subtitles (SRT) file is required as input. Use this if you already have a way of transcribing video (such as Davinci Resolve Studio's built-in subtitles feature, or CapCut subtitles) and you just want subtitles with a custom theme.

#### Creates themed subtitles from an SRT file.
### Step 1
Install any version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tick `"Add python.exe to PATH"` during installation)
### Step 2
Download **[`auto-subs-light.py`](https://github.com/tmoroney/auto-subs/blob/main/auto-subs-light.py)** and place it in the `Utility` folder of the Fusion Scripts folder.

# FAQ
### 1. Auto-Subs not opening
Verify that Resolve detects your Python installation by opening the Console from the top menu/toolbar in Resolve and clicking `py3` at the top of the console.
Ensure that `Path` in your system environment variables contains the following:
- `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312`
- `C:\Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\`
### 2. Can't find Fusion folder
Use [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) to quickly search your computer for it (Windows only).
### 3. MacOS Error
    <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)>
**Solution:** Run this command in the terminal (replace the Python directory with wherever Python is installed on your computer).

    /Applications/Python\ 3.11/Install\ Certificates.command
### 4. Check Python version being used by Resolve
`import sys` + `print (sys.version)` in the Resolve console.
### 5. Issues during Whisper setup
[This video](https://youtu.be/ABFqbY_rmEk) may help you (Only the first 6 minutes are necessary).

## Future Features
1. "Improve Timestamps" button to refine subtitle timing.
2. Speaker Diarization (different coloured subtitles for different people speaking).
3. Auto-translation (generate subtitles in a different language to the one being spoken).
4. ChatGPT Integration
